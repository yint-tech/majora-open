# Majora

Majora is a complete proxy IP construction cluster solution for proxy IP pool supply chain systems. If you have a large number of network devices (VPS servers, router devices, mobile devices, etc.) that can access the internet, you can use these network devices to easily build your proxy IP pool.

## Majora can be used in the following scenarios:

- If you are a proxy IP supplier with a large number of VPS nodes, you can quickly build your proxy IP pool using Majora.
- If you can flash the Majora terminal program into routers or other network devices, you can use Majora to build your home IP resource pool or ADSL IP resource pool.
- If you install Majora's APK or integrate Majora's SDK into your mobile application, you can quickly build your mobile export IP resource pool (if your mobile device is rooted, you can also have the function of scheduled replay).

## Majora's features include:

- Easy to use: All terminal nodes can be connected to the proxy IP cluster with just one-click installation, without the need for complex server parameter configuration.
- Multiple suppliers and buyers: You can allow multiple suppliers with network devices to connect to the Majora system, and multiple IP users can also connect to Majora's IP resources. Majora records detailed billing transactions for each supplier and buyer, allowing you to settle costs based on these transactions.
- Complete protocol support: This system fully supports HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy protocols, and all proxy ports automatically recognize the proxy protocol. Users do not need to manually select ports.
- Reliable IP quality: Majora provides services through tunnel proxies, with exposed port ranges. It also provides memory-level IP resource failure routing. Except for rare cases (interrupted connections in ongoing requests), Majora ensures that each proxy port on the supply side can provide stable proxy services. There will never be a situation where the proxy cannot be connected or cannot be used.
- Support for multiple network devices: Supports servers (VPS), mobile devices, routers, and PCs (regular Windows or Mac computers).
- High concurrency and high bandwidth: The NIO framework naturally supports very high throughput, and Majora's predecessor system (Rogue) has already undergone stress testing with single-node bandwidth of hundreds of megabits.
